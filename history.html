    <h>History of San Isidro National High School</h>
    <p>The San Isidro Barangay High School was founded in 1969 headed by Aurelio Z. Crispo Jr. through the assistance of former Municipal Councilor Romeo Itable. This was embodied by a Barangay Resolution No. 45, s. 1969 which aimed at availing affordable secondary education in the barangay.</p>
    <p>During that time, classes were held at the barangay hall where the first teacher was Mrs. Liwayway F. De Pasion under the management of the elementary principal Ms. Vivencia A. Perez.Other elementary school principals supervised the school such as Mr. Pedrito Advincula, Mr.Esmeraldo Portes, Miss Belen Revilla and Mr. Serafin Portes since it was temporarily housed in San Isidro Elementary School compound. Some residential houses were also utilized as classrooms. More teachers came to serve the school. Aside from Mrs. De Pasion, the pioneers of the school are Mrs.Edelisa P. Bueno, Mr.Amador de Leon, Mr. Oscar Consolacion and Mr. Dominador Crispo.</p>
    <p>In 1981, Mr. Nicolas P. Regio donated a lot with an area of 2,500 square meters. This inspired parents to organize the general PTA to lead the construction of makeshift classrooms. It was July 1983 when a three- classroom building funded by the national government was constructed. The building was called Bagong Lipunan Building Type III. As the school develops, more teachers came to serve the increasing populace of the school such as Mrs. Milagros M. Paglinawan, Mrs. Paz R. Palillo, Mrs. Margarita Beltran, Mrs.Teresita P. Aguirre and Mrs. Juliana A. Crispo.</p>
    <p>In 1988, there was a national proclamation that secondary education in all public schools is free. Due to this, enrolment increased abruptly. In the same year, Mr. Policarpio Ricafrente donated a lot with an area of 1,000 square meters. The following year, 1989, the name San Isidro Barangay High School was changed to San Isidro National High School. During this time, the teacher in charge of the school was Mrs. Perlita A. Virtucio who then became principal in 1991.Classrooms were concreted with restrooms and ceiling fans. A library was provided for the students. Computer units were donated by Congressman Danilo E. Suarez. The official school publication named Peninsula Balita (PENBA) was created. Adjacent lot was purchased to address the needs of increasing student population.

De la Rosa, Mr. Peter Loslos, Mr. Francisco Odiame, Ms. Cristina Hugo, Ms. Amelia Marino, Mr. Adolfo Penaverde, Ms. Wilma De Rosas, Mr. Reno Cabangon, Ms.Divina Ricafrente and Mr. Ramil Dimapiles.  When Mrs. Virtucio retired in May, 2005, Ms.Estrella Manibo became the officer in charge of the school. </p>
    <p>In September, 2005 Mrs. Florinda H. Morada became the school head of San Isidro National High School.In the following years, additional school buildings were constructed such as the Principal Led Building and DPWH Building. School canteen became functional. Additional units of computer were donated by then Vice Governor David C. Suarez. Concretization of fences started.</p>
    <p>For the reason that SINHS is the largest secondary school in Catanauan in terms of enrolment, this is considered by Isidronians as students choice. Two secondary schools were annexed to it but as of May 2007, they had been separated and were named San Vicente Kanluran National High School and Tagabas Ibaba national High School respectively.In 2009, a two-storey, six classroom-building was constructed during the governance of Governor Raffy P. Nantes.</p>
    <p>Teachers also moved to and from San Isidro National High School during this period such as Mrs. Cherry M. Jalos, Miss Marielle Oregenes and Miss Cristina Vergara. PTA funded guards were hired consecutively such as Mr. Antonio Crispo and Mr. Crispo Odiame.</p>
    <p>Improvement in facilities benchmark the progress of the institution. Main gate was repaired. The school was equipped with hi-tech gadgets such as digital camera, laptop computer and printer, LCD projector and fingerprint scanner. Moreover, fountain, multipurpose concrete pavement and stage were constructed. More fences were concreted. The stage of the PTA building was repaired. The school won second place in the Gulayan sa Paaralan Contest in the municipal level.</p>
